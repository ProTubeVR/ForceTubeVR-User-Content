ForceTubeVR User Documentation

1 - Button

- To put on a ForceTubeVR, you only have to press the on/off button. You should see two lights from your ForceTubeVR when it is on. 

- To put it off, make sure you unplugged it and press the on/off button for 3 seconds. If a light was blinking, it should freeze and you should feel a little rumble when you can release the button.

2 - Battery and LED

- A little LED, always red, means the ForceTubeVR microcontroller is on.

- The other LED (the batteries level LED) is red when you have low batteries, green when it is on middle of batteries charge and white when it has more than 80% of batteries charge. 
This LED blinks (0.71 Hz) when the ForceTubeVR isn't connected (it means it is free to pair or connect) and is static when it is connected. 
It blinks very quickly (0.33 Hz) if you have a battery cell with a perilously low charge level. At this state, the ForceTubeVR should stop any connection.

- You can charge the ForceTubeVR by plugged in by USB-C. It will automatically stop the charge when the ForceTubeVR is fully charged. You can't put it off when it is plugged in.
The batteries level LED turns orange when the ForceTubeVR is plugged in and is charging. If it turns white and still plugged in, it means the batteries charge is over. 

3 - Bluetooth pairing

- To use the ForceTubeVR, you first have to put it on and to pair it by Bluetooth in your OS (Android for a Oculus Quest and Windows for other headsets).

3.1 - On Windows

- To pair it on Windows 10, plug your Bluetooth dongle in your computer, put on your ForceTubeVR and make sure it isn't connected (the batteries level LED shouldn't blink). 
Open the Windows settings, click "Devices" > "Bluetooth and other devices". Then turn on the Bluetooth if it isn't done and click "Add Bluetooth or other device" > "Bluetooth". 
When your ForceTubeVR appears in the list of available devices, click it. Wait a few seconds while your ForceTubeVR is paired to Windows.

- If your ForceTubeVR is paired on Windows but can't connect in games or Companion Application, it may be due to a pairing to the bad Bluetooth transmitter.
It is a Windows problem : Windows uses to only work with one Bluetooth transmitter, but all devices ever paired to one transmitter can't be paired to another.
This problem can occur if you have different Bluetooth transmitters installed or even if you only moved your Bluetooth dongle to a new USB port and Windows had difficulties to recognize it, asuming it is a new Bluetooth dongle even if it isn't.
So you should try to remove the ForceTubeVR to pair it again.
If you have difficulties to remove it, you should go to you Device Manager, click "View" > "Show Hidden Devices", and open the "Bluetooth" tab.
In this "Bluetooth" tab, you should uninstall all unconnected devices (they have clearer icons) by right-clicking them and selecting "Uninstall device" and restart your computer.
Once done, try to pair again your ForceTubeVR on Windows.
If you accidentally remove a device you shouldn't, try to unplug it, restart your computer and plug it again.

3.2 - On Oculus Quest

- To pair a ForceTubeVR on Oculus Quest, put the ForceTubeVR and the Oculus Quest on and, in the Oculus Quest home, click "Settings" > "See all" > "Experimental features". 
Next to "Bluetooth pairing", click "Pair". Scroll the list of devices and when you find your ForceTubeVR, click it. After some seconds, click "Pair".
